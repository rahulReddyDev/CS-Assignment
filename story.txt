Two friends were passing through a dense forest. Suddenly they heard some animal screaming. They froze in fear,but when the sound persisted, they decided to help the stricken beast, even at the risk of their own lives. They walked towards the direction of sound, arming themselves with staves made from tree branches.They saw that at a distance there was an animal. A hunter was aiming at it. It was screaming for help. The two friends thought quickly. They jumped down from the branches and ran in the direction of the hunter. They threw sticks and fruits from the nearby trees in the direction of the hunter. Then they ran past him. He got distracted and lost his aim. In the meantime the animal got a chance to escape. He quickly jumped and ran away into the forest.
The hunter now turned his attention to his friends. Filled with rage on losing his target, one he had been pursuing for the past 2 days he reloaded the barrel and aimed at the friends and demanded an explanation. When he saw they were too fearful to answer he fired two warning shots in the air. He then tried to reload again but realized he was out of ammo. That's when the friends made the escape and lived to tell the tale.
